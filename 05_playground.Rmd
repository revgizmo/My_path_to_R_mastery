## [Building a Hacker News scraper with 8 lines of R code using rvest library](https://datascienceplus.com/building-a-hacker-news-scraper-with-8-lines-of-r-code-using-rvest-library/)

* Cool, simple idea for web scraping in R, but the character strings created by this method didn't line up (there were links with no link_domain or score)


```{r}
#install.packages('rvest')
library(rvest)

url <- 'https://news.ycombinator.com/'

#further pages 
#url2 <- 'https://news.ycombinator.com/news?p=2'

content <- read_html(url)

#News Title

title <- content %>% html_nodes('a.storylink') %>% html_text()

#News Link Domain

link_domain <- content %>% html_nodes('span.sitestr') %>% html_text()

#Link Score / Upvote

score <- content %>% html_nodes('span.score') %>% html_text()

#Link Age (submission time)

age <- content %>% html_nodes('span.age') %>% html_text()

#Final Dataframe

#df <- data.frame(title = title, link_domain = link_domain, score = score, age = age)
#Naive way of extracting the entire page content with this table
#tb <- content %>% html_node('table.itemlist') %>% html_text()


```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Test
```{r test}
test1 <- 1 + 1
test1
```


`r test1`

```{definition, name="Pythagorean theorem"}
For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the length of the hypotenuse
and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the other two sides, we have
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
```
